## Hi there 👋

https://project-flipkart-clone.vercel.app/


This project is a Flipkart-inspired e-commerce website UI clone developed using only HTML5 and CSS3.
The goal of this project is to understand and implement real-world frontend layouts used in large-scale e-commerce platforms.

The website replicates the visual structure of Flipkart, including a navigation bar, search section, banner slider, and multiple horizontally scrollable product sections such as sports, furniture, and electronics.

No JavaScript has been used in this project. All layouts, scrolling behavior, and responsiveness are achieved purely through CSS Flexbox, media queries, and modern styling techniques.
